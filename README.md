# odin-landing-page

This is my solution for the Landing Page Projet for The Odin Project's foundations course.

It was a fun challenge dealing with flexbox. I'm sure my css declarations must look really repetitive, I'll be working on cleaning them up later on.

Thanks to whoever reads this, and thanks to the amazing Odin Project!
